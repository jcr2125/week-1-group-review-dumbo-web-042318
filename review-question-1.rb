pokemon.find { |a_pokemon| a_pokemon[:name] == "bulbasaur" }[:abilities][0][:ability][:url]

pokemon1 = pokemon.find_all do |pokemon_hash|
  pokemon_hash[:base_experience] > 40
end

pokemon.collect { |a_pokemon| a_pokemon[:name] }

print pokemon.any? { |a_pokemon| a_pokemon[:weight] > 60 }




# How would you get the url for Bulbasaur's ability?
# How would you return the first pokemon with base experience over 40?
# How would you return ALL OF THE pokemon with base experience over 40? (Gotta catch em all)
# How would you return an array of all of the pokemon's names?
# How would you determine whether or not the pokemon array contained any pokemon with a weight greater than 60?
#  whatever method you use should return true if there are any such pokemon, false if not.
